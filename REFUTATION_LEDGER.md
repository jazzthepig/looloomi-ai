# Refutation Ledger — what we've disproven, and what it taught

> *Failures are more important than successes. A refuted hypothesis is permanent
> knowledge: it maps where not to dig and stops us paying to re-learn it. This is the
> graveyard, kept on purpose — the accumulated negative space that a real research loop
> compounds. Every killed idea gets an entry. Nothing is deleted; superseded entries are
> marked, not removed.*

**Rules:** an entry is added the moment a hypothesis is falsified, nulled, or found to be
a measurement error. Each carries the *number* that killed it (not a vibe) and the lesson
that generalizes. Before proposing a new test, grep this file — if it's here, don't re-run it.

## R1 🔴 Empirical edge-map direction generalizes (the "edge gate")
- **Hypothesis:** the tier×band alpha grid's IC-derived *direction* predicts forward returns OOS.
- **Test:** walk-forward OOS, BH-FDR, net of costs (Minimax-A A2, commit 0e868a7).
- **Result:** loses in BOTH windows across ALL 4 dirs; 4 straight longs into a falling BTC (−$479) while the frozen `REGIME_CIS_FLOOR` baseline made money (+0.59 Sharpe, PF 1.38). p=0.867 — null not rejected.
- **Lesson:** an in-sample IC grid is a description, not a predictor. Cleverness overfit; the humble quality gate survived. Anything anchoring on this direction is presumed overfit until it passes the same harness.
- **Fallout:** `conviction_book` (same anchor) quarantined; paper sleeve reverted to risk-meter.

## R2 ⚪ Price/TA meta-labeling lifts the swing lineage
- **Hypothesis:** a secondary model on entry features (direction, leverage, hour, weekday, pair) improves SwingOverlayV7's trade selection.
- **Test:** logistic meta-label, IS-train / OOS-measure, chronological split.
- **Result:** null — OOS Sharpe/trade 0.272 → 0.274; it just cut 37% of trades for no per-trade gain.
- **Lesson:** the swing system is already efficient on price data. You cannot squeeze more alpha from the same MACD/RSI/ATR signal — improvement must come from an *orthogonal* input, not re-labeling the same one.

## R3 ⚪ Naive ensembling beats the best single strategy
- **Hypothesis:** equal-weight / inverse-vol blending the positive strategies raises risk-adjusted return.
- **Test:** blend vs best single on daily returns.
- **Result:** worse — blended ann Sharpe 2.8 vs V7 alone 4.0. Dilution by weak sleeves.
- **Lesson:** blending correlated/uneven strategies destroys value. Combination only helps with *orthogonality*, and weighting must respect it (→ R4).

## R4 🟡 More strategies = more diversification
- **Hypothesis:** our 5 DSR-certified strategies are 5 independent bets.
- **Test:** correlation matrix + effective number of bets (ENB).
- **Result:** mean mutual corr 0.67 (V8/V9/V10 = 0.95–1.00); ENB = 2.16. Five strategies ≈ ~1.5 ideas.
- **Lesson:** the certified arsenal is one idea in five costumes. The next unit of Sharpe comes from ONE uncorrelated sleeve, not a sixth swing variant. Conditional truth: diversification is real only when correlation is measured, not counted.

## R5 🔴 Directional CIS momentum bots beat buy-and-hold
- **Hypothesis:** LS_V4 / META_V4 (CIS-gated directional) are deployable alpha.
- **Test:** freqtrade backtest vs BTC-hold.
- **Result:** CAGR −6.59% / −5.47% vs BTC-hold +24–26%. Lose.
- **Lesson:** the crowded directional lane is ~zero-edge for everyone; don't tune the losers. Keep one representative (`REGIME_CIS_FLOOR`) as a filter, not as alpha.

## R6 🔴 Trend-following captures the parabolic winner (HYPE)
- **Hypothesis:** a mechanical trend rule rides the HYPE-type move.
- **Test:** trend rule on HYPE vs buy-and-hold.
- **Result:** +37% vs buy-and-hold +110% — the stop chopped us out of the exact asset we most wanted to hold.
- **Lesson:** on a genuine value/narrative winner, the alpha is *selection + conviction hold*, not trend micro-management. Trend times entry and avoids catastrophe; it must not dictate exit on a thesis-intact winner. (→ CONVICTION_METHODOLOGY.md)

## R7 🟡 Expanding the causal sleeve's universe adds edge
- **Hypothesis:** widening funding-crowding from 24 → 50 perps improves it (more breadth = finer signal).
- **Test:** re-run backtest, 24 vs established-40 vs all-50, masked for listing dates.
- **Result:** 24 majors +1.34 Sharpe / 10% DD; established-40 +1.07 / 16%; all-50 **+0.12 / 30%**.
- **Lesson:** funding-crowding is a LARGE-CAP phenomenon — on thin/new names funding is noise and swamps the signal. Expand for capacity behind a liquidity gate, never indiscriminately. (Signal-specific: the conviction/right-tail sleeve is the opposite — it lives in the small/new names.)

## R8 ⚪ Funding acceleration improves the positioning sleeve
- **Hypothesis:** adding funding *acceleration* to funding *level* sharpens the crowd-fade.
- **Test:** blended signal, accel weight 0 → 1.0, on the 24 majors.
- **Result:** monotonic degradation — 1.34 → 1.23 → 1.09 → 0.76.
- **Lesson:** the level IS the signal; acceleration is noise. Don't add a second term to a clean signal without an OOS reason.

## R9 🔵 "Upstream causes are empty on Railway" (false alarm)
- **Hypothesis (mine, wrong):** the cause caches weren't populating in prod (fs/pos = 0 for all assets).
- **Test:** re-probed the live universe payload, correct fields.
- **Result:** false alarm — the causes ARE live; the data is NESTED (`forward_supply:{...}`), I'd read a flat field. ONDO fs_risk=0.702, pos=−0.405.
- **Lesson:** verify the *schema* before declaring a break; a measurement bug in the checker looks identical to a system break. Built `/internal/loop-health` (reading correct fields) so this class of error can't recur silently. Retracted the P1 I'd filed to Minimax.

## R10 🔵 "The narrative engine is wired and working"
- **Hypothesis (implicit):** NMA was a live, functioning signal.
- **Test:** actually ran `compute_narrative_signal`.
- **Result:** it output a degenerate ~44 NEUTRAL for everything — CG killed `community_data` (social=35 fallback), orderflow hit spot endpoints that 400 on perps, trend was pytrends-429-flat. Orphaned: never fed the S-pillar, never surfaced.
- **Lesson:** "referenced in the code" ≠ "flowing." An endpoint can return fallback constants for months and look alive. Now repaired (all 3 sources real) + the loop-health probe guards it.

## R11 🔵 "The narrative trend/orderflow fix works" (worked in sandbox, flat in prod)
- **Hypothesis (mine):** rerouting NMA trend + orderflow to Binance (fapi) repaired them.
- **Test:** post-push live check of `/api/v1/market/narrative`.
- **Result:** flat 50 in prod (social differentiated, trend+orderflow not) — Binance is GEO-BLOCKED on Railway US; the fix worked only in the sandbox's egress. Rerouted both to CoinGecko (Railway-safe) → differentiated.
- **Lesson:** "works in sandbox" ≠ "works on Railway" for ANY Binance-sourced signal. Verify data-source reachability in the TARGET environment, not just locally. CoinGecko is the Railway-safe primary. Same family as R9/R10 — the check is the product.

## R12 🔴 Price-based sector valuation-rotation works in crypto (the naive 韭圈儿 port)
- **Hypothesis:** 韭圈儿's sector value-rotation (overweight cold / underweight hot by valuation percentile) ports to crypto using a price-vs-trailing-mean temperature.
- **Test:** 8 crypto sectors, weekly rotation, net of costs.
- **Result:** fails — long-short Sharpe +0.04, long-only cold-tilt −0.16 / −25% / 109% DD (cheap kept falling).
- **Lesson:** A-share value-rotation works because EARNINGS anchor price (PE/PB mean-revert). Crypto has no earnings floor, so a price-cheap signal is momentum-reversion = value trap. The template needs a REAL fundamental temperature (MVRV-Z / mcap-TVL / mcap-fees) AND catalyst+trend gating (CONVICTION L2/L4) — value alone is a trap (see R6). Report: `reports/SECTOR_VALUATION_2026-07-11.md`.

## R13 🔴 H3.2 conviction-sizing transfers from Nautilus LS v1 to swing overlay
- **Hypothesis:** the H3.2 sizing pattern (`trade_size × (0.5 + c) ∈ [0.5, 1.5]×`, c ∈ [0,1] conviction) — winner on LS v1 (+$1.79 to +$2.14 per-trade IS, +$0.10 to +$2.25 OOS across all 8 A/B runs) — adds edge when applied to swing overlay entries (V11: per-pair trailing-7-day funding z-score → direction-aware sizing multiplier).
- **Test:** V11 = clean A/B on V9 (only positioning sizing added). Walk-forward 3 windows (TRAIN 2024 bull / VALIDATE 2025 chop / HOLD-OUT 2026 recovery) × 2 variants (5-pair + ETH-only) = 6 backtests.
- **Result:** loses. V11 5-pair +2,774.6 USDT vs V9 +3,169.8 (-12.5% P&L), trades 1,211 vs 1,297 (-6.6%). V11-ETH +1,311.1 vs V9-ETH +1,421.2 (-7.7%), trades flat. Three forces: (1) avg-stake effect (-5% to -7% stake × similar trades = mechanical loss); (2) z-score distribution biased by market microstructure (crypto funding is structurally positive → longs μ_z ≈ +1.27-1.41, shorts μ_z ≈ -2.20-2.27, BOTH sides get shrunk on average; "fade the crowd" becomes permanent downsize); (3) **mechanism mismatch** — H3.2 works in CROSS-SECTIONAL books where conviction = which name to overweight; in PER-PAIR swing entries, conviction = how much to size, and swing's regime-stake (900/600/400) + naked-short (×1.5) system already does similar work, so the two conviction layers stack non-additively.
- **Lesson:** **NOT a falsification of H3.2** — H3.2 still wins on LS v1 (its native habitat) and was bumped cap 1.5→1.75 same-day. It IS a **boundary finding**: an LS-v1-native pattern doesn't necessarily transfer to directional swing. A proven pattern on one strategy family is not portable to another without its native data shape (cross-sectional, not per-pair) and without checking what the target family already does for conviction. Builds on R4 (orthogonality math): another swing variant, even with an orthogonal signal, doesn't beat V9 because swing's existing sizing absorbs the new signal. V12 direction = CROSS-SECTIONAL positioning z (Causal Sleeve native form) — the right port of the signal to test next. **Carrier note:** V11 retained for archival + as documented counter-example. Report: `_data/research/V11_CausalSized_2026-07-10.md`.

## R13 🔴 "Gated fee-value is validated" (single-split artifact — walk-forward refuted)
- **Hypothesis:** gating fee-value by momentum (value+catalyst) beats value alone OOS — I claimed it validated on a single 60/40 split (gated OOS +0.75 vs value +0.31).
- **Test:** 7 rolling 180-day walk-forward folds.
- **Result:** gated positive only 3/7 folds, mean +0.24, FULL +0.06 — *worse* than value-alone +0.56. The single-split win was a lucky 2025–26 cut.
- **Lesson:** ONE OOS split is NOT validation — walk-forward across multiple folds is the bar. Same failure mode as R1 (edge gate): I got enthusiastic about a number; the loop caught it. Also: value+catalyst is NOT proven by this fee-value implementation (still a hypothesis). Report/data: fee_value_gated_momentum_20260711 (experiment_runs).

## What the graveyard says, in aggregate

1. **Cleverness overfits; simple survives.** (R1, R2, R8) Every added degree of freedom lost OOS. The winners are the humble ones (REGIME_CIS_FLOOR, funding-level).
2. **Edge is orthogonality, not more of the same.** (R3, R4, R6, R7, R13) Directional breadth, correlated blends, and thin-name expansion all destroyed value; even an orthogonal signal doesn't transfer when the *frame* doesn't match (cross-sectional LS conviction ≠ per-pair swing sizing). The one thing that helped was an *uncorrelated* sleeve in its native frame.
3. **"Wired" is not "working."** (R9, R10) Two of our biggest gaps were things that *looked* connected. Verify the number and the schema, not the reference.
4. **Portability of patterns has limits.** (R13) H3.2 won on LS v1; porting it to swing gave −12.5%. A proven pattern's home is its data shape (cross-sectional vs per-pair) and what the target family already does (swing already has its own conviction layer). Test portability, don't assume it.
5. **The loop's job is to kill our ideas cheaply.** Nine of ten here died before a dollar was at risk. That is the system working, not failing.

*The most valuable output of this operation is a well-kept graveyard.*
